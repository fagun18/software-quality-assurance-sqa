                <div class="arrow"></div>
            </div>
            <div class="answer" id="qa6">
                Test-driven development (TDD) is a development approach where developers write tests for a specific piece of functionality before implementing the code. The process starts with writing a test case that initially fails. Developers then write the minimum code necessary to pass the test, refactor as needed, and repeat the cycle for each new piece of functionality.
            </div>
        </div>

        <div class="qa-section">
            <div class="question" onclick="toggleAnswer('qa7')">7. What is exploratory testing?
                <div class="arrow"></div>
            </div>
            <div class="answer" id="qa7">
                Exploratory testing is an informal testing approach where testers explore the software without predefined test cases. Testers use their domain knowledge and creativity to uncover defects by interacting with the application as an end user would. The goal is to find issues that might not be easily identified through scripted testing.

<div class="qa-section">
    <div class="question" onclick="toggleAnswer('qa11')">11. What is boundary testing?
        <div class="arrow"></div>
    </div>
    <div class="answer" id="qa11">
        Boundary testing is a software testing technique where test cases are designed to evaluate the application's behavior at the boundary limits of input values. The goal is to identify defects related to boundary values, such as minimum and maximum values. For example, if a function accepts values from 1 to 100, boundary testing would include tests with inputs 1, 100, and values just outside this range (e.g., 0, 101).
    </div>

<div class="qa-section">
    <div class="question" onclick="toggleAnswer('qa14')">14. What is the difference between smoke testing and sanity testing?
        <div class="arrow"></div>
    </div>
    <div class="answer" id="qa14">
        Smoke Testing and Sanity Testing are both types of software testing executed during different phases of the development lifecycle:
        <ul>
            <li>Smoke Testing: A preliminary test executed on the initial build of the software to ensure that it can handle basic functions. It verifies if the critical functionalities are working before proceeding with further testing.</li>
            <li>Sanity Testing: Performed after a software build is released with minor changes or bug fixes. It ensures that the specific bugs reported earlier have been fixed without introducing new defects.</li>
        </ul>
